# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate of the University of Toronto Mississauga with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I am currently a software developer at Jarvis Consulting Group, where I have gained experience working in an Agile environment, developing various projects using technologies such as Java, PostgreSQL, Bash, Maven, Docker, and Git. I also have experience using other technologies for academic projects, including React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Python. My passion for computer science, which began in a high school introductory class, stems from my love of overcoming difficult problems with creative solutions. I am looking for an opportunity to apply and grow my skill-set in the software development or full-stack industry.

    description: "Designed an application in Bash and SQL used to monitor system specifications and performance on a cluster network. Each system in the network gathers hardware specifications and resource usage using Bash scripts, which are then submitted to a PostgreSQL database, hosted on a single system running a Postgres Docker container. The application is scheduled to run regularly on each system using crontab."

    description:
      - "Twitter App: Developed a CLI application in Java used to perform CRD operations on Tweets. Using the arguments provided from the command-line, the application submits the information to the Twitter REST API. The OAuth library was used to authenticate the app to a user account, Maven for building and dependency management."
      - "JDBC App: Developed an application in Java using the JDBC API to perform CRUD operations on a Postgres database. App implements DAO pattern to allow for abstraction of database operations. App built using Maven."
      - "Grep App: Developed an application in Java emulating the Linux grep utility. Using Java regex libraries, app searches through files in a specified directory and all of its sub-directories recursively, listing lines that match the regular expression provided. App built using Maven, and containerized using Docker."

    description: Created a full-stack web application as part of a team of 4. Application was designed near the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as a forum where elderly, immunocompromised, and any other users can make requests that can be fulfilled by other users. Posts were listed in a Twitter-like feed, which was created, along with the rest of the front-end, using React. Other features included direct messages, a leaderboard page, and Google Maps integration. The back-end and REST API handling user and post data were created using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. App was hosted online using Heroku.
