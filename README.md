# Max Huang . Jarvis Consulting

I'm Max, a recent graduate of the University of Toronto Mississauga with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I am currently a software developer at Jarvis Consulting Group, where I have gained experience working in an Agile environment, developing various projects using technologies such as Java, PostgreSQL, Bash, Maven, Docker, and Git. I also have experience using other technologies for academic projects, including React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Python. My passion for computer science, which began in a high school introductory class, stems from my love of overcoming difficult problems with creative solutions. I am looking for an opportunity to apply and grow my skill-set in the software development or full-stack industry.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_end_MaximilianHuang](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_end_MaximilianHuang)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_end_MaximilianHuang/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed an application in Bash and SQL used to monitor system specifications and performance on a cluster network. Each system in the network gathers hardware specifications and resource usage using Bash scripts, which are then submitted to a PostgreSQL database, hosted on a single system running a Postgres Docker container. The application is scheduled to run regularly on each system using crontab.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_end_MaximilianHuang/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Developed a CLI application in Java used to perform CRD operations on Tweets. Using the arguments provided from the command-line, the application submits the information to the Twitter REST API. The OAuth library was used to authenticate the app to a user account, Maven for building and dependency management.
  - JDBC App: Developed an application in Java using the JDBC API to perform CRUD operations on a Postgres database. App implements DAO pattern to allow for abstraction of database operations. App built using Maven.
  - Grep App: Developed an application in Java emulating the Linux grep utility. Using Java regex libraries, app searches through files in a specified directory and all of its sub-directories recursively, listing lines that match the regular expression provided. App built using Maven, and containerized using Docker.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_end_MaximilianHuang/tree/master/springboot)]: Not Started

## Highlighted Projects
**Helping Hands** [[GitHub](https://github.com/manacute/helping_hands)]: Created a full-stack web application as part of a team of 4. Users can register accounts and create "request" posts that can be fulfilled by other users. Front-end was developed using React, and back-end using Node.js, and MongoDB. REST API was developed using Express.js supporting CRUD operations on posts and user accounts. Was hosted online using Heroku.
